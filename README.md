# Temperature Alarm System

A temperature alarm system created using Mbed OS for the LPC1768 development board with an mbed application board.

An LM75B temperature sensor is used to detect the temperature. If the temperature goes too low or too high, the blue and red LEDs respectively act as warning alarms. The high and low limits are set using the potentiometers.<br>

The display on the LCD can be changed to display temperature in Celcius, display temperature in Farenheit or a display blank screen. This can be controlled using the centre button of the joystick on the application board or using a serial input to control the display by pressing the 'C', 'F' or 'B' keys for Celcius, Farenheit and blank.
